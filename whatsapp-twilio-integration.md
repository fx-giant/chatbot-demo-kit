3. Pass the Auth SID and Auth Token to the AVA Chatbot Service Admin (supervisor), to allow AVA Service to get the credentials to access Twilio Sandbox.
4. Get the AVA Chatbot Webhook URL from AVA Chatbot Service Admin (supervisor)
> Another way to get the AVA Chatbot Webhook URL Access Token is by running the Chatbot Simulator through GIANT and cross referencing its URL to the Sample URL
(if it is already existing)
> Sample URL: `https://chat-api.fusionexgiant.com/api/v2/Agent/<agentId>/Whatsapp/Webhook/Twilio?=<AccessToken>`

> Sample AVA Chatbot Webhook URL `https://chat-web.fusionexgiant.com/#/73c222f60a6544ea9735befa0b59a940?t=7e0f34a55bbb4e5824489d90e654113eec31d3cd55703b170aae5f5d6ce5c4055f2309fe442d8a378f92a52a38b63403`
5. Replace `<agentId>` and `<AccessToken>` from the Sample URL with the information of the new AVA Chatbot Webhook URL
> Sample URL for Twilio: `https://chat-api.fusionexgiant.com/api/v2/Agent/73c222f60a6544ea9735befa0b59a940/Whatsapp/Webhook/Twilio?=7e0f34a55bbb4e5824489d90e654113eec31d3cd55703b170aae5f5d6ce5c4055f2309fe442d8a378f92a52a38b63403`
